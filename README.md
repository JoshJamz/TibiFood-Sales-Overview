## Sales Analysis 

### Project overview  

**Description:**
This project involves conducting a comprehensive data analysis and business review for Tibi Foods, a fictional quick service restaurant chain store operating in Nigeria. The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful insights from a dataset containing information on successful and rejected orders from the last two quarters.

## Data Source 

The dataset comprises data from Tibi Foods' operations on Chowdeck, an online platform for ordering meals. It includes details such as order creation times, delivery times, acceptance times, pick-up times, and other relevant metrics. Please note that this dataset is fabricated for the purpose of this analysis and does not represent real order data.

### Objectives:

- Provide an overview of Tibi Foods' current business status.
- Evaluate Tibi Foods' performance in Q4 2023 relative to Q3 2023.
- Offer recommendations to help Tibi Foods improve and grow their revenue based on the insights derived from the dataset.

### Approach:

- Data Cleaning: Utilized MS Excel for data cleaning tasks, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.
- Data Exploration: Used SQL queries to interrogate the cleaned dataset and explore various metrics such as GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), order count, delivery time,pickup time, wait time, successful delivery percentage, and more.
- Visualization: Created clear and compelling visualizations using Power BI to present the findings of the analysis effectively. These visualizations includes interactive dashboards and reports to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Key Findings:

- Conducted comprehensive EDA using SQL queries and Excel to explore various aspects of Tibi Foods' business operations.
- Analyzed order creation times, delivery times, acceptance times, pick-up times, and other relevant metrics to understand the overall performance.
- Identified trends and patterns in order volumes, delivery times, and successful delivery rates across different quarters.
- Examined the distribution of delivery times and acceptance times to identify outliers and potential areas for improvement in operational efficiency.
- Investigated the relationship between order success rates and factors such as delivery time and pick-up time to understand their impact on customer satisfaction.
- Utilized Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends, including GMV, order count, and successful delivery percentage, providing stakeholders with actionable insights.
- Discovered a slight decrease in order volumes in Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023, indicating a potential need for targeted marketing efforts to boost sales.
- Observed a decrease in successful delivery rates in certain locations, suggesting the need for improved logistics and delivery management strategies.
- Identified a correlation between longer delivery times and higher order cancellations, highlighting the importance of optimizing delivery processes to reduce wait times.
- Recommended implementing strategies to streamline order processing, improve delivery efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction based on the key findings from the EDA.

Through EDA, we gained valuable insights into Tibi Foods' business performance and identified areas for optimization to drive revenue growth and operational excellence.
